# Udacity Blog Project

## Create a Personal Blog using HTML and CSS

For this project I used HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript to create a responsive personal blog. Within the blog there are two pages: a homepage and a blog post.

### Things to Note:

- I created this blog for practice. That being said, most of the links and buttons do not lead anywhere.
- The only interactive component is the mobile navigation menu.
