# Udacity Blog Project

## Create a Personal Blog using HTML and CSS

For this project I used HTML and CSS to create a responsive personal blog. Within the blog there are two pages: a homepage and a blog post.

Things to Note:

- I worked with multiple stylesheets, all of which were imported to main.css. The stylesheets beginning with "home" are related to styling made to the homepage, nav.css is for navigation styling, and stylesheets with "post" are for styling done to the blog post page. The common.css file holds styles that all the pages of the site share in common.
- The site is not interactive or connected to a database so although there are buttons on the site, clicking on them will have no effect.
